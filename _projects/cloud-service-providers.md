## Cloud Service Providers

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offering low or moderate impact cloud services to federal agencies must meet FedRAMP requirements.  CSPs that successfully navigate FedRAMP:

* Implement the FedRAMP baseline security controls
* Hire an Independent Assessor to perform an independent system assessment
* Create and submit an authorization package
* Provide continuous monitoring reports and updates
* CSPs doing business with federal agencies should  review the Security Assessment Framework (SAF). They should also become familiar with FedRAMP’s four process areas: Document, Assess, Authorize, and Monitor, which align to the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) covered in NIST SP 800-37.  Once familiar with the  requirements, CSPs should complete a FedRAMP Initiation Request and follow one of two ways for achieving an authorization: JAB Provisional Authorization (P-ATO) or Agency Authorization.

CSPs must then complete a FIPS 199 worksheet to categorize the type of data that is contained within the system. CSPs select and implement the FedRAMP security controls baseline to match the categorization level. CSPs document the details of the implementation in their System Security Plan (SSP).

Next, CSPs engage an independent assessor to evaluate the implementation of the FedRAMP baseline security controls. CSPs that seek a JAB P-ATO must use a FedRAMP Accredited Assessor. CSPs that want to submit an Agency Authorization package may have their cloud system assessed by an agency validated Independent Assessor.

After testing has been completed, Independent Assessors (IA) delivers the Security Assessment Report (SAR) to the CSP for review. The SAR is then shared with the authorizing official’s security team to determine the overall risk of the system. The IA and CSP create a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) to address specific vulnerabilities in the system. The CSP then submits a final security assessment package for review and the decision to authorize a cloud system is formalized in an agency ATO Letter.

Once authorized, CSPs enter the continuous monitoring phase that provides transparency into the CSP system and the ability to make timely risk-management decisions.  The FedRAMP continuous monitoring phase involves three steps: operational visibility, change control process, and incident response.  CSPs should review the Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide to understand these steps.
