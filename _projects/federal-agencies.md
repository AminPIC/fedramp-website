## Federal Agencies

Agencies engage with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Independent Assessors, and the FedRAMP PMO to meet FedRAMP requirements. Agencies that successfully navigate FedRAMP:
* Leverage the FedRAMP PMO process and the JAB-approved FedRAMP security authorization requirements as a baseline when initiating, reviewing, granting and revoking security authorizations for cloud services
* Require cloud service providers to meet FedRAMP requirements via contractual provisions
* Identify and annually report on cloud services being used that do not meet FedRAMP requirements
* Assess, authorize and continuously monitor security controls of cloud systems
* Additional information on the role of agencies can be found on the Security Assessment Framework.

### Initiate
Establishing a comprehensive inventory of all cloud services within an agency is a critical step on the path to FedRAMP authorization. Once established, the agency can review the Cloud Best Practices White Paper for information on creating effective cloud computing contracts. The agency must work with CSPs to update contractual requirements and determine the path each cloud system will take in order to become FedRAMP authorized. FedRAMP has developed a FedRAMP Standard Contract Clauses and Control Specific Contract Clauses documents to assist agencies in procuring cloud services. The agency’s role in the FedRAMP process will vary depending on the path of the cloud system. Careful coordination between CSPs, agencies, and the FedRAMP PMO will ensure that all parties use resources effectively to meet FedRAMP requirements.

### Implement
With the “do once, use many times” framework, FedRAMP allows for agencies to reuse authorization packages that have already been completed. Agencies can review the authorization packages that are available by submitting a FedRAMP Package Request Form. If a security package is not available for leveraging and an agency decides to work with a CSP to grant an Agency ATO, they will become very familiar with the FedRAMP assessment process through reviewing the Agency ATO Quick Guide. In this process the CSP documents the cloud system security controls, an independent assessor tests those controls, and the team produces a final security assessment package.

### Authorize
Whether leveraging an existing FedRAMP security assessment package or following the FedRAMP assessment process within an agency, an agency’s Authorizing Official will need to ultimately make a risk-based decision to grant the cloud system in question an Authority to Operate (ATO) within the agency. The decision will be formalized in an ATO letter provided to the CSP system owner. Prior to authorizing a cloud system, the agency will implement customer and shared responsibility controls. They will then conduct a thorough review of the security assessment package to determine that it is complete, consistent, and conform with FedRAMP requirements.

### Monitor
Continuous monitoring is part of the risk management process of FedRAMP, and is a requirement for all CSPs to maintain an ATO. Agencies must take charge in managing the continuous monitoring responsibilities for cloud services with an Agency ATO. For an Agency ATO, the agency must provide at minimum a yearly update on the CSP’s security authorization package including the continuous monitoring activities from the past year. The FedRAMP ongoing assessment and authorization process involves three steps: operational visibility, change control process, and incident response. More information on the monitoring process can be found on the Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide.

### Report
Executive departments and agencies must provide in PortfolioStat quarterly reports listing all cloud services used by the agency to the Office of Management and Budget. The reports must include all cloud systems regardless if they are FedRAMP authorized or not. For those systems that are not FedRAMP authorized, the agency must provide appropriate rationale and proposed resolution for achieving authorization. The reporting occurs through the E-Gov Integrated Data Collection effort using MAX Collect.
