## Third Party Assessors

Assessors perform initial and periodic assessments of cloud systems to ensure they meet FedRAMP requirements.  Once engaged with a CSP, independent assessors:

1. Complete a Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
2. Perform initial and periodic assessments of cloud system security controls
3. Conduct security tests and produce Secure Assessment Reports (SARs)

CSPs wanting to meet FedRAMP requirements through the JAB P-ATO path or CSP submitted path must be assessed by an accredited assessor.  To become an accredited assessor, candidates must submit application materials demonstrating that they meet both technical competence in security assessment of cloud systems and management requirements for organizations performing inspections.

The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) accredits FedRAMP assessors with the FedRAMP PMO providing final approval. Please contact A2LA for more information on becoming an accredited FedRAMP assessor.

To learn more about independent assessors and their role in the FedRAMP process, please review the Security Assessment Framework (SAF) .
