Claudio Belloli joined the FedRAMP team in July 2014 as the Program Manager for Cybersecurity. In that role, Claudio oversees all of the cloud service providers (CSPs) going through the JAB P-ATO authorization process. He manages the PMO’s ISSO team and serves as the primary liaison to the JAB CIO’s Technical Representatives and their review teams. Claudio is responsible for ensuring authorization packages meet the rigorous reviews set forward by the JAB and that vendors with JAB P-ATO continue to maintain their authorizations through Continuous Monitoring.

Claudio previously worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, where he served as the lead cloud security advisor supporting the DOD CIO. He was an original member of the DOD JAB technical review teams for the first FedRAMP provisional ATOs in 2012. He will continue to bring his cybersecurity and cloud expertise as FedRAMP expands the CSPs we authorize through the JAB.
